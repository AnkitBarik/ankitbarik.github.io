Grid Agnostic MHD for Extended Research Applications (GAMERA) is written in modern Fortran and provides a flexible, portable, and exascale-capable MHD code. It uses the finite volume method to simulate magnetospheric dynamics.

I was involved in adapting GAMERA to [Mercury](/project/mercury) in order to accurately compute the field-aligned currents (FACs) and better correct the MESSENGER data. More information on GAMERA here : https://cgs.jhuapl.edu/Models/gamera.php .
