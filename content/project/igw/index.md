Angular momentum transport from core the envelope of massive stars has been a subject of active research. During the [Kavli Summer Program In Astrophysics 2021](https://kspa.soe.ucsc.edu/archives/2021), I supervised student Hachem Dhouib from CEA Saclay to study this in a 3 solar mass ZAMS star using the `MagIC` code. The star has a convective zone in the center, followed by a stably stratified layer at the top. We found that the emanation of internal gravity waves in the radiative zone leads to an angular momentum transport in the star.
