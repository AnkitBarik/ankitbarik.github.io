`planetMagFields` is a package that provides an easy interface to plot and analyze planetary magnetic field data. planetMagFields is free and open source and is available at https://github.com/AnkitBarik/planetMagFields .

`planetMagFields` provides a very easy access to the Gauss coefficients of a planet's magnetic field obtained from inversion of planetary mission data. It also provides a very easy interface to plot, analyze and even produce files for 3D visualization of a planet's magnetic field (as shown in the picture).
