I taught these series of lectures in the course Planetary Interiors by Sabine Stanley. I covered the following topics:

- Overview of planetary magnetic fields
- Spherical harmonics and Gauss coefficients
- Dynamo theory
- Dynamo simulations and experiments

The origin of planetary dynamos lies in conducting fluids in their interiors with different planets having a different conducting fluid.
