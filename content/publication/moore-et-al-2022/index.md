abstract: Understanding Jupiter's present-day interior structure and dynamics is key
  to constraining planetary accretion models. In particular, the extent of stable
  stratification (i.e., non-convective regions) in the planet strongly influences
  long-term cooling processes, and may record primordial heavy element gradients from
  early in a planet's formation. Because the Galileo entry probe measured a subsolar
  helium abundance, Jupiter interior models often invoke an outer stably stratified
  region due to helium rain. Additionally, Juno gravity data suggest a deeper, potentially
  stratified dilute core extending halfway through the planet. However, fits to Jupiter's
  gravitational data are non-unique, and outstanding uncertainty over the equations
  of state for hydrogen and helium remain. Here, we use high-resolution numerical
  magnetohydrodynamic simulations of Jupiter's magnetic field to place constraints
  on the extent of stable stratification within the planet. We find that compared
  to traditional interior models, an upper stably stratified layer between 0.9 and
  0.95 Jupiter radii (RJ) helps to explain both Jupiter's dipolar magnetic field and
  zonal winds. In contrast, an extended dilute core that is entirely stably stratified
  (no convective layers) yields significantly worse fits to both. However, our models
  with extended deep stratification still generate dipolar magnetic fields if an upper
  stratified region is also present. Overall, we find that a planet with a dilute
  core i.e., strongly stably stratified is increasingly challenging to reconcile with
  Jupiter's magnetic field and winds. Thus if a dilute core is present, alternative
  modalities such as a fully convective dilute core, a complex multilayered interior
  structure, or double diffusive convection may be required.
