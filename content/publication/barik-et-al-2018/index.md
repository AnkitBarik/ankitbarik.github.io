abstract: The spherical Couette system, consisting of a viscous fluid between two
  differentially rotating concentric spheres, is studied using numerical simulations
  and compared with experiments performed at BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg, Germany. We
  concentrate on the case where the outer boundary rotates fast enough for the Coriolis
  force to play an important role in the force balance, and the inner boundary rotates
  slower or in the opposite direction as compared to the outer boundary. As the magnitude
  of differential rotation is increased, the system is found to transition through
  three distinct hydrodynamic regimes. The first regime consists of the emergence
  of the first non-axisymmetric instability. Thereafter one finds the onset of `fast'
  equatorially antisymmetric inertial modes, with pairs of inertial modes forming
  triadic resonances with the first instability. A further increase in the magnitude
  of differential rotation leads to the flow transitioning to turbulence. Using an
  artificial excitation, we study how the background flow modifies the inertial mode
  frequency and structure, thereby causing departures from the eigenmodes of a full
  sphere and a spherical shell. We investigate triadic resonances of pairs of inertial
  modes with the fundamental instability. We explore possible onset mechanisms through
  numerical experiments.
