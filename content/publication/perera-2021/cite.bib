 abstract = {The future viability of the geosciences is challenged, since as a community we continue to lack
demographic diversity representative of the wider population. Fundamentally, dominant cultural,
historical, and socioeconomic factors contribute to the lack of diversity and those factors typically
change slowly over generations. Proposals for more immediate changes have had some effect but
have not led to large-scale changes in the demographics of the geosciences. In this commentary,
we discuss the concept of intergroup emotions and recommend its use as a strategy for improving
diversity and inclusion within the geosciences. Intergroup emotions are emotions that arise as
a result of an individualâ€™s identification with one or more social groups, which makes them particularly
pertinent in the context of diversity and inclusion. While we call on the geoscience community
to conduct discipline-based research in collaboration with educational and social
psychologists, we argue that there is sufficient evidence to also begin implementing interventions
in classrooms, laboratories, and in the field. We believe strategies based on intergroup emotions
will make significant improvements in diversity and inclusion within the geosciences.},
