abstract: The future viability of the geosciences is challenged, since as a community
  we continue to lack demographic diversity representative of the wider population.
  Fundamentally, dominant cultural, historical, and socioeconomic factors contribute
  to the lack of diversity and those factors typically change slowly over generations.
  Proposals for more immediate changes have had some effect but have not led to large-scale
  changes in the demographics of the geosciences. In this commentary, we discuss the
  concept of intergroup emotions and recommend its use as a strategy for improving
  diversity and inclusion within the geosciences. Intergroup emotions are emotions
  that arise as a result of an individualâ€™s identification with one or more social
  groups, which makes them particularly pertinent in the context of diversity and
  inclusion. While we call on the geoscience community to conduct discipline-based
  research in collaboration with educational and social psychologists, we argue that
  there is sufficient evidence to also begin implementing interventions in classrooms,
  laboratories, and in the field. We believe strategies based on intergroup emotions
  will make significant improvements in diversity and inclusion within the geosciences.
