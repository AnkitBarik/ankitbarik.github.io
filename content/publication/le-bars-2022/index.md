abstract: Understanding fluid flows in planetary cores and subsurface oceans, as well
  as their signatures in available observational data (gravity, magnetism, rotation,
  etc.), is a tremendous interdisciplinary challenge. In particular, it requires understanding
  the fundamental fluid dynamics involving turbulence and rotation at typical scales
  well beyond our day-to-day experience. To do so, laboratory experiments are fully
  complementary to numerical simulations, especially in systematically exploring extreme
  flow regimes for long duration. In this review article, we present some illustrative
  examples where experimental approaches, complemented by theoretical and numerical
  studies, have been key for a better understanding of planetary interior flows driven
  by some type of mechanical forcing. We successively address the dynamics of flows
  driven by precession, by libration, by differential rotation, and by boundary topography.
