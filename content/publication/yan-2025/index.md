abstract: Seismic measurements from the NASA Mars InSight mission revealed that Mars'
  core has a relatively low density, implying a larger fraction of lighter elements
  than previously thought, which further leads to a low melting temperature. Thus,
  Mars probably never developed a solid inner core during its early history when the
  dynamo was active. We perform full-sphere dynamo simulations to eliminate the influence
  of an inner core on dynamo behaviors and investigate how various magnitudes of heat
  flux perturbations at the core-mantle boundary affect the field morphology, comparing
  results to those from models with small inner cores. We find that a hemispheric
  magnetic field can result when the heat flux is concentrated in one hemisphere.
  Moreover, a dynamo model without the presence of an inner core can better explain
  Mars' crustal magnetic field dichotomy than that in a spherical shell surrounding
  a solid inner core.
