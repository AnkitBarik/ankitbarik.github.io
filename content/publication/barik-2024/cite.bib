 abstract = {Long term observations and space missions have generated a wealth of data on the magnetic fields of the Earth and other solar system planets. `planetMagfields` is a Python package designed to have all the planetary magnetic field data currently available in one place and to provide an easy interface to access the data. `planetMagfields` focuses on planetary bodies that generate their own magnetic field, namely Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Ganymede. `planetMagfields` provides functions to compute as well as plot the magnetic field on the planetary surface or at a distance above or under the surface. It also provides functions to filter out the field to large or small scales as well as to produce `.vts` files to visualize the field in 3D using Paraview, VisIt or similar rendering software. Lastly, the `planetMagfields` repository also provides a Jupyter notebook for easy interactive visualizations.},
