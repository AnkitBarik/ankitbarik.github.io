abstract: Magnetic field observations from the MGS, MAVEN, and InSight missions reveal
  that a dynamo was active in Mars's early history. One unique feature of Mars's magnetic
  crustal field is its hemispheric dichotomy, where magnetic fields in the southern
  hemisphere are much stronger than those in the northern hemisphere. Here we use
  numerical dynamo simulations to investigate the potential hemispheric nature of
  Mars's ancient dynamo. Previous studies show that a hemispheric heat flux perturbation
  at the core--mantle boundary could result in either a stable hemispherical magnetic
  field or a constantly reversing field, depending on choices of parameters used in
  those models. These two scenarios lead to different implications for the origin
  of crustal fields. Here we test the dynamo sensitivity to varying hemispheric heat
  flux perturbations at the core--mantle boundary in a broader parameter regime to
  understand whether a hemispheric dynamo is likely for early Mars. We find that features
  of the dynamo change from stable, hemispheric magnetic fields to reversing, hemispheric
  fields, with increasing hemispheric heat flux perturbations at the core--mantle
  boundary. We also find that magnetic fields powered by bottom heating are more stable
  and transition from a nonreversing, hemispheric magnetic field to a multipolar field
  at higher hemispheric heat flux perturbations, while the transition happens at a
  much lower heat flux perturbation for magnetic fields powered by internal heating.
