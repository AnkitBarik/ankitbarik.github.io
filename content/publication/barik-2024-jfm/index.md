abstract: The spherical Couette system consists of two differentially rotating concentric
  spheres with the space in between filled with fluid. We study a regime where the
  outer sphere is rotating rapidly enough so that the Coriolis force is important
  and the inner sphere is rotating either slower or in the opposite direction with
  respect to the outer sphere. We numerically study the sudden transition to turbulence
  at a critical differential rotation seen in experiments at BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg,
  Germany, and investigate its cause. We find that the source of turbulence is the
  boundary layer on the inner sphere, which becomes centrifugally unstable. We show
  that this instability leads to generation of small-scale structures which lead to
  turbulence in the bulk, dominated by inertial waves, a change in the force balance
  near the inner boundary, the formation of a mean flow through Reynolds stresses
  and, consequently, to an efficient angular momentum transport. We compare our findings
  with axisymmetric simulations and show that there are significant similarities in
  the nature of the flow in the turbulent regimes of full three-dimensional and axisymmetric
  simulations but differences in the evolution of the instability that leads to this
  transition. We find that a heuristic argument based on a Reynolds number defined
  using the thickness of the boundary layer as a length scale helps explain the scaling
  law of the variation of critical differential rotation for transition to turbulence
  with rotation rate observed in the experiments.
