Our group made this TED-Ed style video on the magnetic fields of the planets of our solar system. The animation was done by the wonderful scientific illustrator [Yi Zheng](https://www.yizhengillustration.com/) during an internship in our department facilitated by the Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute ([HEMI](https://hemi.jhu.edu/)). Feel free to use it for your outreach efforts!
