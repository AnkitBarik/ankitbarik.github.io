DIYnamics develops inexpensive apparatuses for teaching fundamental concepts in Earth sciences, with an emphasis on geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD), in classrooms from the elementary school to university levels. We use LEGOs to build fluid dynamics experiments (how cool is that?!). Visit https://diynamics.github.io/ for more information. Also check out our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@diynamicsteam6015) and follow us on [Twitter](https://x.com/DIYnamicsTeam)!
