For several months in 2018 and 2019, I volunteered at the [Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum](https://airandspace.si.edu/), getting visitors to look through telescopes at the [Phoebe Waterman Haas Public Observatory](https://airandspace.si.edu/visit/museum-dc/phoebe-waterman-haas-public-observatory) when possible and working on Discovery tables inside when the clouds got the better of us.

Eventually after a nose surgery and research life getting more busy, the routine commute to Washington, DC became too much and I had to stop.
